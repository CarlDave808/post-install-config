With osTicket now fully configured, we'll move on to system administration tasks by setting up new roles within the help desk. This will enable you to effectively control user access and permissions.

To set up new roles in the help desk, navigate to Admin Panel->Agents->Roles. Select "Add New Role", then enter a name for the role such as "Supreme Admin".

From There, you can define the permissions and responsibilties assigned to the role. Since this is a Supreme Admin role, be sure to enable all available permissions to grant complete administrative access.
